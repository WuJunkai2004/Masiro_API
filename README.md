# Masiroer
This a SDK for API of masiro.me  
> Due to the developer's current busy schedule with academic pursuits, the project is expected to commence officially in July and be completed before September.

The goal of Masiroer is to create an SDK that is as cross-lingual as possible, in preparation for developing Masiro-based applications.  
The project will consist of one or multiple parsing programs and multiple sets of parsing configurations.  
At the current stage, the developer will provide parsing programs developed using Python.  
As per the current plan, parsing configurations will be categorized into four types: self, menu, user, and book.
